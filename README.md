# App Services Lab React Application

As part of the App Services Lab we have built a React application to demonstrate how we can call App Services HTTPS Endpoints from within an appliction, using the Realm SDK.
The application uses a theme downloaded from [StartBootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2) and customised for our needs.

## Dependencies

In order to successfully run the application the following dependencies have been installed and can be found in the node_modules folder. If when running the application it complains about missing dependencies, you can install them with the commands below, after navigating in the application's folder:
> [Realm SDK](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/)
> 
>     npm install realm

> [Realm Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm-web)
> 
>     npm install realm-web

> [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
> 
>     npm install axios

> [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
> 
>     npm i react-router-dom

## Running the application

After downloading the application, navigate into the folder and run the following command to start the application in a browser

    npm run start
